# Employee Management System (EMS) - Node.js Backend

## Introduction
The Employee Management System (EMS) is a Node.js-based backend system that facilitates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for employee data. This system provides a robust foundation for managing employee information efficiently.

## Features
- **Create:** Add new employees to the system with relevant details.
- **Read:** Retrieve employee information including details like name, ID, position, etc.
- **Update:** Modify existing employee records to reflect changes or corrections.
- **Delete:** Remove employees from the system when necessary.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js:** Server-side JavaScript runtime for building scalable network applications.
- **Express.js:** Web application framework for Node.js, simplifying the development of APIs.
- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database for storing and managing employee data.
- **Mongoose:** ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.

## Getting Started
